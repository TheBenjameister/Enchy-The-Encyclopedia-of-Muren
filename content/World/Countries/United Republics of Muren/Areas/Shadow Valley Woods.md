## Area Description 
A lush green forest south of Daggerport, the Shadow Valley Woods spans from the Lunarch Ascent mountain range to the Obren Mountains. 
## Area Information
Besides a few hours in the day, the forest is cast in shadow due to the mountains that it grows between. Various Wild animals live here, so it's best to stay on the road, though most people try to avoid going through the woods themselves.
